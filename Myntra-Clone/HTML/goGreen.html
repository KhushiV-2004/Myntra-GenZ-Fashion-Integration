      <h1>GoGreen Initiative</h1>
      <p>
        Our GoGreen initiative is aimed at promoting sustainability and protecting the environment. As part of this scheme, customers are encouraged to return the packaging material used for their purchases. This helps us to recycle and reuse the materials, significantly reducing waste and promoting a circular economy.
      </p>

      <h2>Environmental Impact</h2>
      <p>
        Did you know that packaging waste accounts for 40% of total plastic waste? By reusing and recycling packaging materials, we can make a significant impact on reducing environmental waste and promoting a greener planet.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Myntra, we are committed to reducing our carbon footprint and promoting eco-friendly practices. Our GoGreen initiative is one step towards creating a sustainable future for everyone.
